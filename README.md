# 💻 Digital Employment Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project investigating how digitalization influences the labor market and employment patterns across economic sectors.

This project applies multivariate statistical techniques to identify relationships between technological adoption indicators and workforce structure using real-world socio-economic data.

The objective is to understand how the expansion of digital technologies reshapes employment, workforce participation, and sectoral distribution of jobs.
